## Project Overview

Color Vision Deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 350 million people worldwide. Existing recoloring tools apply the same color transformation to every pixel, making safety-critical objects like traffic lights indistinguishable from other red objects (billboards, brake lights).

This project proposes a **two-stage semantic-aware recoloring pipeline** that:
1. Uses a U-Net to produce a **class-aware priority map** — assigning each pixel a recoloring weight based on its semantic class.
2. Feeds the priority map + original RGB image into a **MAU-Net corrector** that applies stronger recoloring to safety-critical regions (traffic lights = 1.0) and leaves low-priority regions (sky, buildings = 0.1) natural.

### Priority Class Weights

| Class | Priority Value |
|---|---|
| Background / Sky / Buildings | 0.1 |
| Vegetation | 0.1 |
| Person / Cyclist | 0.4 |
| Vehicle | 0.7 |
| Traffic Light / Sign | 1.0 |

## Stage 1 — Priority Map U-Net (Complete)

See [`stage1_priority_map_unet/`](./stage1_priority_map_unet/)

**U-Net Architecture:**
- Input: RGB image `[3, 256, 256]`
- Encoder: 4× (Conv3×3 → BN → ReLU ×2, MaxPool) — channels 64→128→256→512
- Bottleneck: 1024 channels
- Decoder: 4× (TransposeConv + skip concat + Conv3×3 → BN → ReLU ×2)
- Output: `[1, 256, 256]` sigmoid priority map

**Training Setup:**
- Dataset: Road-Traffic Dataset (HuggingFace)
- Ground truth: generated on-the-fly via DeepLabV3 + HSV hybrid
- Image size: 256×256, Batch: 4, Epochs: 25, LR: 1e-4
- Optimizer: Adam with weight decay; Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau
- Loss: MSE + weighted BCE

**Stage 1 Results (Best ~Epoch 25):**

| Metric | Epoch 1 | Best |
|---|---|---|
| Train Loss | ~0.85 | ~0.02 |
| Val Loss | ~0.28 | ~0.02 |
| Val MAE | ~0.055 | ~0.020 |
| Traffic Light Hue IoU | ~0.15 | ~0.50 |

## Stage 2 — MAU-Net Corrector (Planned — Finals)

- Input: `[R, G, B, Priority]` 4-channel tensor
- Architecture: Modified Multi-Attention U-Net (MAU-Net) from Nathanael & Prasetyo (2024)
- Loss: L1 + Perceptual loss after CVD simulation
- Only MAU-Net trains; U-Net stays frozen
